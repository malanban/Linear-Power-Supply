# Linear-Power-Supply (1.5A)
## ABSTRACT
We had to create a linear power supply with a maximum current restriction (also known as over-current protection).Our power source need to be able to deliver consistent output voltage for various variable output loads as well as to a fluctuating input line voltage. This report explains the functionality of Linear power supply which can give output as from 8V to 14V.This is bassed on the module EN2111 - Electronic Circuit Design, Which is conducted by Dr. Thayaparan Subramaniam.

## INTRODUCTION OF LINEAR POWER SUPPLY

* Output voltage of an unregulated power supply will vary depending on the load and on variations in the AC supply voltage
* Linear regulator may be used to set the voltage to a precise value, stabilized against fluctuations in input voltage and load
* Regulator also greatly reduces the ripple and noise in the output direct current
* Linear regulators often provide current limiting, protecting the power supply and attached circuit from over-current
* Adjustable linear power supplies allow the output voltage to be adjusted over a range
* Line regulation is a measure of the circuit’s ability to maintain the specified output voltage with varying input voltage
* Load regulation is a measure of the circuit’s ability to maintain the specified output voltage under varying load conditions.
* Load regulation and Line regulation values apply to the output
* The worst case value is the addition of both line and load tolerance percentages.
